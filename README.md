# Movie-App

This is a portfolio based project for the Full Stack Web Development course from CareerFoundry. It is to showcase both the back-end and front-end skills
I am learning as a student. 

I built an API with Node.js and Express, using REST architecture creating URL endpoints. I used a body-parser package for reading the 
data requests and Morgan for logging those requests. A package.json file was created for the API as well. I used MongoDB to build the database and the business 
logic was modelled with Mongoose. This was written in JavaScript code. The API was tested using Postman and all endpoints passed 
testing. I was able to add authentication with tokens to user login and user endpoint requests. This all used validation logic and meet data security regulations. 
The API was deployed using Heroku and the code is all accessible publicly on GitHub. 

While there are many views, the application is a SPA (single-page application) I used state routing to navigate between views and created options to filter 
and sort movies. I used Parcel to build the client-side initially and it was written using React and React Redux. I used Bootstrap as a UI for styling and 
responsiveness and used a mix of class and function components. It is hosted online using Netlify. 

See documentation for specifc end-point information.
